# Air-Quality-Power-Bi-Dashboaard
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing air quality data to assess pollution levels, health risk categories, and environmental trends for data-driven decision making.

# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution has a direct impact on public health and quality of life. This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes air quality data to identify pollution patterns, health risk levels, and trends over time.

The dashboard is designed to help users quickly understand **how severe air pollution is**, which periods are most risky, and how air quality changes across time and conditions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze air quality data using Power BI
- Create meaningful KPIs and health risk indicators
- Categorize air quality into risk levels
- Visualize trends and comparisons interactively
- Support data-driven environmental awareness

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains air quality measurements including:
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Pollutant levels
- Date / Time attributes
- Derived health risk indicators

Each record represents air quality observations for a given time period.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- DAX (Calculated Columns & Measures)
- Data Modeling
- Interactive Visualizations

---

## 🔄 Dashboard Development Process
1. **Data Import**
   - Loaded air quality dataset into Power BI

2. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)**
   - Removed null and inconsistent values
   - Corrected data types
   - Created clean, analysis-ready tables

3. **Data Modeling**
   - Designed relationships between tables
   - Optimized model for performance

4. **DAX Calculations**
   - Created calculated measures for:
     - Average AQI
     - Health Risk Score
     - Pollution Severity Categories

5. **Dashboard Design**
   - Used KPI cards for key metrics
   - Applied slicers for interactive filtering
   - Designed clean and business-friendly layout

---

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features
- **AQI KPI Cards** – quick view of pollution severity
- **Health Risk Categorization** – Low, Moderate, High
- **Trend Analysis** – AQI changes over time
- **Category Distribution** – pollution severity breakdown
- **Interactive Filters** – date and category-based analysis

---

## 🚨 Air Quality Risk Categories
| AQI Range | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|
| 0 – 50  | Good |
| 51 – 100 | Moderate |
| 101 – 200 | Unhealthy |
| 200+ | Severe |

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- High AQI periods indicate increased health risk
- Pollution levels fluctuate significantly over time
- Certain periods consistently show poor air quality
- Categorization simplifies complex environmental data

---

## 📌 Business & Public Health Use Cases
- Environmental monitoring and reporting
- Public health awareness dashboards
- Policy planning and pollution control strategies
- Early warning insights for high-risk periods

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset is limited to available records
- Real-time AQI data not integrated
- External factors like weather events not included

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Real-time AQI API integration
- City-wise and location-based analysis
- Predictive air quality trends
- Public-facing dashboard deployment
